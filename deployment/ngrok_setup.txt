How to Open the Project and Navigate to the 'ui' Folder

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Change directory to your project folder:

   On Windows:

   cd C:\path\to\your\project

   On macOS/Linux:

   cd /path/to/your/project

3. Navigate to the 'ui' folder inside your project:

cd ui

4. Verify you are in the 'ui' folder by listing files:

   On Windows:

   dir

   On macOS/Linux:

   ls

You should now be inside the 'ui' directory.

Step 1: Run your Streamlit app on port 8051

In your terminal (now inside the 'ui' folder), run:

streamlit run your_app.py --server.port 8051

Replace your_app.py with your Streamlit app’s filename.

---

Step 2: Verify Streamlit app is running

Open your browser and visit:

http://localhost:8051

You should see your Streamlit app running locally.

---

Step 3: Expose your Streamlit app with ngrok

Open a new terminal window and run:

ngrok http 8051

Ngrok will generate a public URL (usually https://xxxx.ngrok.io) forwarding to your local app.

---

Step 4: Access your app remotely

Copy the HTTPS URL provided by ngrok and open it in any browser to access your Streamlit app over the internet.

Troubleshooting Tips

- If you encounter connection errors, try running ngrok with the host header option:

  ngrok http -host-header=localhost 8051

- Ensure no firewall or antivirus software is blocking port 8051.

- Always start your Streamlit app before running ngrok.
